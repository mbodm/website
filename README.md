# MBODM Website

This repo contains my rather simple http://mbodm.com website.

### General info
I use this GitHub repo for my website, just for some easier maintaining. This repo is public. But since my site is rather simple structured (no backend pre-rendering or anyting like that, just simple static hosting), the whole source of my site is sent to the browser anyway. So it does not really matter much, if this repo is private or public. 😉 Of course this does not mean, i am super happy when you fork my personal website. You know what i mean.

### License info
I used some typical GitHub MIT predefined license for my site. Feel free to reuse any code from my site. Since i am not a multibillion-dollar-company, there is not much to protect. 😁 But: Said MIT license is valid for the whole source code (but "only" the code). Since the website contains a font, icons and a photo, you find specific license informations for them, inside the [site/img/license.txt](site/img/license.txt) file. So please have a close look at this file.

#### Have fun.
