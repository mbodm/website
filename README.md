# MBODM website

This repo contains my rather simple http://mbodm.com website.

### General info
I use this GitHub repo for my site, just for some easier maintaining. This repo is public. But since my site is rather simple structured (no backend pre-rendering or anyting like that - just simple static hosting), the whole source of my site is sent to the browser anyway. So it does not really matter much, if this repo is private or public. 😉 Of course this does not mean: I will be super happy when someone forks my personal website. But i think you ppls know what i mean.

### License info
I used some typical GitHub MIT predefined license for this repo. Feel free to reuse any code from my site. Since i am not a multibillion-dollar-company, there is not much to protect. 😁 But: Said MIT license is valid for the whole source code (but "only" the code). Since the site contains a font, icons and photos, you find specific license informations for them, inside the [site/img/license.txt](site/img/license.txt) file. So please have a close look at this file, before using anything from inside the [site/img](site/img) folder.

#### Have fun.
