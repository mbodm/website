# MBODM Website

This repo contains my rather simple http://mbodm.com website.

### General info
I use this GitHub repo for my website, just for some easier maintaining. This repo is public. But since my site is rather simple structured (no backend pre-rendering or anyting like that, just simple static hosting), the whole source of my site is sent to the browser anyway. So it does not really matter, if this repo is private or public. 😉

### License info
I used some typical GitHub MIT predefined license for my site. Feel free to reuse stuff from my site. Since i am not a multibillion-dollar-company, there is not much to protect. 😁

Have fun.
